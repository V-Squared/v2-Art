We are adding artwork tp our wiki pages to increase legibility. This artwork need to be stored somewhere. Since we want to collaborate on artwork, we place it on GitHub too. GitHub has actually quite nice revision management tools for artwork. In order to not blow up the file size of the original repository we place all wiki files in here. To keep things organized we use folders in folders tree, rebuilding the same strucure as the wiki page structue.
